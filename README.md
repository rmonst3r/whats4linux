**Whats4Linux** is an unofficial WhatsApp client for Linux with a **native Go backend** and a **lightweight WebKit-based UI**.

It is **not a wrapper around WhatsApp Web**.  
Instead, it directly connects to WhatsApp using the official multi-device protocol via [`whatsmeow`](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow).

The goal of Whats4Linux is to provide a **fast, efficient, Linux-first desktop client** without Electron, Chromium, or browser automation.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Uses **WhatsApp’s real multi-device APIs**
- Native **Go backend** for networking, crypto, and storage
- Lightweight UI rendered using **WebKitGTK (via Wails)**
- No Electron, no Node.js, no Chromium
- **Linux-first** in spirit, cross-platform by design.

## 🧠 Architecture

Whats4Linux follows a **native-backed, web-rendered** architecture:

flowchart LR
    UI["Web UI (WebKitGTK)"] -->|Wails RPC| Go[Native Go Backend]
    Go -->|Multi-Device Protocol| WA[WhatsApp Servers]
    Go --> DB["(SQLite)"]
    Go --> Media[Media Cache]

```

### What is native?
- WhatsApp protocol implementation
- Encryption & crypto
- Message sync & pagination
- Database access
- Media handling
- IPC between frontend and backend

### What is not native?
- UI widgets (HTML/CSS instead of GTK/Qt)

---

## 🚀 Features

### Messaging
- One-to-one chats
- Group chats
- Full chat history sync (TODO)

### Media & Storage
- Linux-native media cache
- SQLite-backed message storage
- Optimized database configuration for chat workloads

### Performance
- Lower memory usage than Electron clients
- No Chromium overhead
- Minimal JS ↔ Go IPC
- Tuned SQLite queries and cache sizes

### Privacy & Security
- Uses WhatsApp’s official encryption via whatsmeow
- No telemetry
- No analytics
- All data stored locally

### Customisation
- Custom JS, CSS allowed
- Custom Bezier curve editor for UI animations
- Easy to use colour scheme editor

## 🐧 Linux-First Design

Whats4Linux is built specifically for Linux:
- Uses WebKitGTK instead of Chromium
- Respects XDG base directories
- Designed for long-running sessions
- Works on both Wayland and X11

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|--------|-----------|
| Backend | Go |
| WhatsApp API | whatsmeow |
| UI Framework | Wails |
| Web Engine | WebKitGTK |
| Database | SQLite |
| IPC | Wails RPC bindings |

## 📦 Building

> ⚠️ Project is under active development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lugvitc/whats4linux
cd whats4linux
wails build
```

This will produce a binary in the `build/bin/` directory.

## 🧪 Development Notes

- The backend exposes strongly-typed APIs to the frontend via Wails bindings.
- Message pagination is optimized for large chat histories.
- SQLite is tuned using WAL mode and controlled cache sizes for high-throughput reads.
- Media loading is lazy to avoid unnecessary memory usage.
- UI performance is carefully tuned to minimize scroll jank and IPC overhead.
- Designed for long-running sessions without gradual memory bloat.
